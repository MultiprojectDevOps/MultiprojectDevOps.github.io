# GitHub Actions

## [Official Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)

We have primarily focused our efforts on GitHub actions. As such, we have 
made copious use of the official documentation. The official 
documentation is dense, but thorough. We recommend using it as a resource for
looking up APIs.

# Multiproject CI/CD Resources

## [Damien Aicheh Blog](https://damienaicheh.github.io/github/actions/2021/10/07/reuse-workflows-composite-action-en.html)

This blog post focuses on how to use GitHub composite actions to reduce
duplication. Of note it advocates for factoring composite actions out into a
new repository and using version tags to refer to a specific implementation of
the composite action.
