# Second Virtual Workshop on Multiproject CI/CD

Abstract submission is open until November 22, 2024
{: .notice}

The MultiprojectDevOps project was founded to establish best practices for
decreasing the time needed to deploy multiple high-quality scientific software 
packages, particularly when the packages share common requirements. Key to
these best practices are maintaining continuous integration/continuous 
deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Since the managed packages share common
requirements the CI/CD workflows will too. We define a multiproject CI/CD 
workflow as a CI/CD workflow that can be reused for multiple projects. The
purpose of this workshop is to share best practices, lessons learned, and
solutions for multiproject CI/CD.

## Organizer: Dr. Ryan Richard
