Ryan Richard is thankful for having had the opportunity to hold a Birds of a Feather (BoF) workshop at the 2024 National Laboratory Information Technology Summit in Seattle, Washington ([Conference Website](https://www.fbcinc.com/e/nlit/default.aspx)) on 4/11/2024 from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM PDT. Ryan is also thankful to the many people who participated in the workshop. The results of this workshop are summarized on this page.

# One pieces of CI/CD do you currently reuse among projects?

This was the icebreaker question. The participants identified:

1. Secrets
2. Artifacts
3. CI/CD pipelines

# How do you currently reuse CI/CD pieces among projects?

In responding to the first question, several participants also identified how they achieved reuse. Naturally, prompting this question. Participant answers included:

1. Artifacts reuse is facilitated by jfrog and sonatype
2. CI/CD pipelines reused through:
   - GitLab components
   - Sharing of templates (presumably through version control)
   - Raw YAML files (copy/paste)

# How are people doing dependency management?

At this point the conversation became more organic and participants noted that one of the hardest parts of CI/CD maintenance is managing dependencies. To which a participant posed this question.

# What tests do your CI/CD pipelines perform?

While the participants were passionate about discussing dependency management, for the sake of time, the topic was changed to types of tests via this question.
