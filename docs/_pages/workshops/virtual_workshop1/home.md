# Virtual Workshop on Multiproject CI/CD

Abstract submission has been extended by another week to June 6, 2024.
{: .notice}

Scientific software is becoming increasingly modular. While this is boon for
reuse, it can lead to maintenance headaches. In particular, the more software
an organization develops the more continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) workflows they must maintain. With an increase in modular software,
it is anticipated that many organizations will find themselves managing CI/CD
for a number of projects. Since these projects are developed by the same 
organization, these CI/CD workflows tend to have common needs that can be
addressed by common solutions.

We founded the MultiprojectDevOps project in order to establish best practices 
for developing and maintaining multiproject CI/CD workflows. While there are a
number of online resources covering best practices of CI/CD for a single 
project, resources dedicated to the maintenance of multiproject CI/CD are more 
scarce. The goal of this workshop is to bring together CI/CD maintainers in 
order to identify challenges encountered in developing multiproject CI/CD and to 
share potential solutions.
