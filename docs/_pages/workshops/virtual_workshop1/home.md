# Virtual Workshop on Multi-Project CI/CD

Abstract submission is now closed.
{: .notice}

Scientific software is becoming increasingly modular. While this is boon for
reuse, it can lead to maintenance headaches. In particular, the more software
an organization develops the more continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) workflows they must maintain. With an increase in modular software,
it is anticipated that many organizations will find themselves managing CI/CD
for a number of projects. Since these projects are developed by the same
organization, these CI/CD workflows tend to have common needs that can be
addressed by common solutions.

We founded the Multi-ProjectDevOps project in order to establish best practices
for developing and maintaining multi-project CI/CD workflows. While there are a
number of online resources covering best practices of CI/CD for a single
project, resources dedicated to the maintenance of multi-project CI/CD are more
scarce. The goal of this workshop is to bring together CI/CD maintainers in
order to identify challenges encountered in developing multi-project CI/CD and
to share potential solutions.

Dr. Ryan Richard, is a computational chemist with joint appointments at
Ames National Laboratory and Iowa State University. He is chief architect and
lead developer of the NWChemEx, an exscale-capable reimplementation of the
popular Chemistry code, NWChem. Dr. Richard was recently named a Fellow by the
[Better Scientific Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program)
in support of his efforts to promote mulitproject CI/CD best practices.

## Logistics

The workshop will be held virtually on Google Meet on June 14, 2024 from 1:00-
3:00 CST.

## Registration

Registration is free. To sign up please fill out this Google form:

may need to down select. Participants whose abstracts are selected for
presentations will be notified by May 30, 2024.

## Agenda

| Time (CST)  | Title                                                                          | Speaker          | Affiliation                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1:00 - 1:10 | Introduction and opening remarks                                               | Ryan M. Richard  | Ames National Laboratory               |
| 1:15 - 1:35 | Standardized CI and dependency management, a prerequisite to Multi-Project CI? | Adrien Bernede   | Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |
| 1:40 - 2:00 | Continuous Integration in the the NWChemEx Stack                               | Jonathan Waldrop | Ames National Laboratory               |
| 2:05 - 2:55 | Birds of a Feather (BoF) session                                               | Ryan M. Richard  | Ames National Laboratory               |
| 2:55 - 3:00 | Closing remarks                                                                | Ryan M. Richard  | Ames National Laboratory               |

The BoF session is intended to be an open discussion among workshop
participants. In attempt to motivate such discussion we have identified a number
of prompts:

1. What tasks do your single, or multi-project, CI/CD pipelines currently
   perform?
2. What pieces of CI/CD do you currently reuse among projects?
3. How are you testing your CI/CD pipelines?
4. How do you manage dependencies among pipelines?
5. Have you tried any existing multi-project CI/CD solutions?
