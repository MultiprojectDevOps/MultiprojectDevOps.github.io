# Virtual Workshop on Multiproject CI/CD

Scientific software is becoming increasingly modular. While this is boon for
reuse, it can lead to maintenance headaches. In particular, the more software
an organization develops the more continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) workflows they must maintain. With an increase in modular software,
it is anticipated that many organizations will find themselves managing CI/CD
for a number of projects. Since these projects are developed by the same 
organization, there will be a natural tendency for the CI/CD workflows to rely
on redundant components.

While there are a number of online resources covering best practices of CI/CD 
for a single project, resources dedicated to the maintenance of multiproject
CI/CD are more scarce. The goal of this workshop is to bring together CI/CD
maintainers in order to identify challenges encountered in developing 
multiproject CI/CD and to share potential solutions.
